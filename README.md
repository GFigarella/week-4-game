# week-4-game

* This is a game where a random number between 18 and 120 is generated, and you have to match it.

* Each crystal will have a random generated value between 1 and 12.

* By clicking the crystals, your score will go up depending on the value of the crystal clicked.

* You won't know what the value of each crystal is until you click it ... it's a leap of faith!

* You win if you match the random number previosuly mentioned.

* You lose if your score goes higher than the random number.
